              We are working on a project as a group. Can we apply for a Lab as
              a group?
            </p>
            <p>
              You cannot apply for a Lab as a group, as individual grades and
              the curriculum vitae of the applicant are important factors in the
              evaluation process of your application. If you are a member of a
              project group, please choose one representative to apply for the
              Lab. If you are selected to participate in a Lab, your group
              representative will present your project. You are obviously free
              to include the names of the group members on your presentation
              slides in order to acknowledge and appreciate the group effort
              behind the project. However, it is important that you clearly
              highlight the extent of your individual contribution to the
              project.

              After applying, the selected participants will be invited to join
              the Falling Walls Lab. There are no costs/fees for participating.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you apply for an international Falling Walls Lab and you don't
              live near the city you selected, you will have to make your own
              arrangements for travel and accommodation. The Falling Walls
              Foundation and international Lab organisers cannot cover any of
              your costs.
            </p>
            <p>
              The winners of each international Falling Walls Lab qualify for
              the Falling Walls Lab Finale on 8 November in Berlin. The hosting
              institutions for each Lab cover your travel epenses to Berlin. A
              scholarship will cover your accommodation expenses at our partner
              hotel from 8 to 9 November and a ticket to the Falling Walls
              Conference on 9 November.

              I don&rsquo;t have a breakthrough yet. Can I participate anyway?
            </p>
            <p>
              By breakthrough we understand an idea, a research project, a
              business model or social initiative, which is at the same time
              original and new, innovative (overcoming old ideas and concepts)
              and relevant to the problems of the world today. This means that
              your breakthrough could be a project you already realised, a
              research topic you are developing or a business idea yet to be
              built up. Our jury members will appreciate authentic presenters
              with a vision and proof of concept.

            </p>
            <p>
              You will find out that it works – and preparing your 3-minute
              presentation will provide you with a new perspective on the topics
              you are working with. Having to shape your topic into a so-called
              "elevator pitch" is a challenging restriction on the one hand –
              but it also emphasises what is most essential about the idea: What
              it is, how it works and what it can be used for.
